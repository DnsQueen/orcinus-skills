description: Capture a raw idea the moment it arrives and keep it in a durable store, so it survives between sessions. Use whenever an idea comes up mid-work, in passing, or outside a calibration session — before it is lost — and when you need to find, promote, or drop a stored idea. Only invoke via the orcinus router.

# IDEA-CAPTURE — a fleeting idea that is not captured is lost

An idea that arrives mid-work and is not written down is gone by the next session. This skill is the store for raw ideas: one Markdown file per idea, in the project's `ideas/` directory, written verbatim and never edited. Calibration is a separate step (`idea-calibrate`); this skill only makes sure the idea is still there when you are ready for it.

## Rules

- Capture first, calibrate later. When a raw idea arrives, write it down before doing anything else with it — before answering, before coding, before the next message.
- Verbatim, always. The raw text is the idea as spoken, with the date and who said it. Never edit, improve, or interpret it after capture.
- The store lives in the project (`ideas/`), committed with it. A store in `/tmp` is lost on the next restart; a store in the project survives.
- A dropped idea is never deleted. Dropping only changes the status and records the reason. The file, the raw text, and the reason stay.
- Statuses move one way: `raw` → `calibrated` → `scoped`, or any → `dropped`. A dropped idea never comes back as raw; if it returns, capture it again as a new idea.

## Steps, in order

### 1. Capture

Run the script (`scripts/capture.py`, Python 3.9+, standard library only):

```
capture.py capture --store <project>/ideas --text "<the idea, verbatim>" --source "<who said it>"
```

It prints the idea id (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-slug`). The slug is ASCII only (a-z, 0-9, hyphen): the raw text may be any language — a Persian-only idea gets the slug `idea` (with a `-2` suffix if two collide in the same second) — while the raw text itself is stored verbatim. An empty idea is refused (exit 1, no file created). If two ideas arrive in the same second, the second gets a `-2` suffix — the id is always unique. The raw text is stored exactly as given; only the emptiness check strips whitespace, and CRLF line endings are normalised to LF. The frontmatter carries `raw_length` (the length of the raw text), so an idea that itself contains a line reading `## History` is not truncated. The source must be a single line (a newline would inject a frontmatter field). The id is strictly validated (only the generated shape is accepted) and the resolved path must stay inside the store, so an id can never escape it — even through a symlink. Listing and searching resolve every file and require it to stay inside the store, and a file whose frontmatter id does not match its filename is reported as malformed. A status change takes a lock file (created with O_EXCL) for the whole read-modify-write, then writes atomically (temp file + replace), so two concurrent changes cannot lose a History entry and an interruption cannot leave a half-written file. A capture creates its file exclusively, so two concurrent captures cannot overwrite each other. A file that cannot be parsed is reported to stderr, never silently skipped.

### 2. Find it later

- `capture.py list --store <project>/ideas` — every idea, with status and date.
- `capture.py list --store <project>/ideas --status raw` — only the unprocessed ones.
- `capture.py search --store <project>/ideas <keyword>` — ideas whose raw text contains the keyword (case-insensitive; works in Persian and English). Search matches only the raw idea text, not the frontmatter or the History, so searching for "raw" or "dropped" does not return everything.
- `capture.py show --store <project>/ideas <id>` — the whole file.

### 3. Move it forward

When the idea is calibrated with `idea-calibrate`, record it:

```
capture.py promote --store <project>/ideas <id> calibrated --note "<what it became>"
```

When the calibrated brief is scoped into v1, promote it to `scoped`. When the idea is not going ahead, drop it — with a reason, always:

```
capture.py drop --store <project>/ideas <id> --reason "<why not>"
```

Every move appends one line to the file's History. The raw text is never touched.

## Report

Return the report in this form:

- Captured (id, date, source).
- Store (path, number of ideas by status).
- Moved (every status change, with the reason).
- Verdict: PASS (the idea is on disk verbatim, findable by search, and every move is recorded) or FAIL (an idea was lost, edited, or deleted, or a move was not recorded).

## Scope

This skill is the store only. It does not sharpen, validate, or scope an idea — that is `idea-calibrate`. It does not decide what to build — that is the user, at the Idea → Code gate. The store is plain Markdown files; there is no database, no server, and no sync — the project's own git history is the backup.

## Sources

Written from scratch. No ready skill answers this need: the research found capture-in-session (idea-calibrate, step 1) but no persistent store for fleeting ideas between sessions.
